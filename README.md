# AngularTodo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.5.

It provides a small todo list application similar to the React version from [ttomaye/TODO-REACT](https://github.com/ttomaye/TODO-REACT). Features include:

- Add, edit and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Filter by all, active or completed tasks
- Persist todos to local storage
- Clear all completed tasks

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
